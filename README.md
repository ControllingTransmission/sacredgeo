# Sacred Geo

Requires HTTPS and microphone connection. Originally developed for Bit Shifter's set at 8bitSF in 2013

Play some music and jam on the keyboard a bit. [Here's a video of it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3y36gRuqkM)

Bit Shifter code was capable of being controlled with the Webkit Gamepad API, but this is way out of date now. Also had a companion website for the crowd to view on their phones that synced a color with the screen as it changed. That was pretty cool, albeit pretty buggy.
