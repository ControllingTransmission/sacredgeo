# Sacred Geo

Requires HTTPS and microphone connection. Originally developed for Bit Shifter's set at GDC 201?

### [View demo on Github](https://controllingtransmission.github.io/sacredgeo/)

Bit Shifter code was capable of being controlled with the Webkit Gamepad API, but this is way out of date now. Also had a companion website for the crowd to view on their phones that synced a color with the screen as it changed. That was pretty cool, albeit pretty buggy.
